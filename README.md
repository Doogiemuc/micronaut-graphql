# Micronaut GraphQL Integration

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/micronaut-projects/micronaut-graphql.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/micronaut-projects/micronaut-graphql)

This project integrates [GraphQL Java](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java) into Micronaut applications.

The Micronaut GraphQL integration can be used together with other GraphQL integration libraries like
[GraphQL Java Tools](https://github.com/graphql-java-kickstart/graphql-java-tools) and [GraphQL SPQR](https://github.com/leangen/graphql-spqr).

See the [User Guide](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-graphql/snapshot/guide/index.html) for
more information about how to use the project.

There are various [examples](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-graphql/tree/master/examples) provided in this repository.
